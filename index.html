          <p>Garrett Brown is a student with the August 2020 Epicodus cohort. Graduating from Pacific University in 2017 with a 
            degree in Anthropology, he has spent the last several years working in the Portland, Oregon theatre community.
            Spending time as a technician and actor, in his free time Garrett worked for a pub quiz company and as a dog walker.
            With theatre on haitus due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, Garrett decided to enroll with Epicodus and learn more about
            the world of coding. <span><a href="https://garrettbrownproductions.com">Click here to visit his personal website.</a></span>
